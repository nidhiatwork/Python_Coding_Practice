'''
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None, next=None):
    self.val = val
    self.left = left
    self.right = right
    self.next = next
    
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
