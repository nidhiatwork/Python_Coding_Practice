Problem
Indicium means "trace" in Latin. In this problem we work with Latin squares and matrix traces.

A Latin square is an N-by-N square matrix in which each cell contains one of N different values, such that no value is repeated within a row or a column. In this problem, we will deal only with "natural Latin squares" in which the N values are the integers between 1 and N.

The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the values on the main diagonal (which runs from the upper left to the lower right).

Given values N and K, produce any N-by-N "natural Latin square" with trace K, or say it is impossible. For example, here are two possible answers for N = 3, K = 6. In each case, the values that contribute to the trace are underlined.

2 1 3   3 1 2
3 2 1   1 2 3
1 3 2   2 3 1

Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of one line containing two integers N and K: the desired size of the matrix and the desired trace.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is IMPOSSIBLE if there is no answer for the given parameters or POSSIBLE otherwise. In the latter case, output N more lines of N integers each, representing a valid "natural Latin square" with a trace of K, as described above.

Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
N ≤ K ≤ N2.

Test set 1 (Visible Verdict)
T = 44.
2 ≤ N ≤ 5.

Test set 2 (Hidden Verdict)
1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
2 ≤ N ≤ 50.

Output

3 6
2 3

  
Case #1: POSSIBLE
2 1 3
3 2 1
1 3 2
Case #2: IMPOSSIBLE

  
Sample Case #1 is the one described in the problem statement.

Sample Case #2 has no answer. The only possible 2-by-2 "natural Latin squares" are as follows:

1 2   2 1
2 1   1 2
These have traces of 2 and 4, respectively. There is no way to get a trace of 3.
